## Act 1: The Problem

Look at this — HuggingFace Papers. Every single day, dozens of new AI papers drop with code. Transformers, diffusion models, agents, state space models. Each one has a paper, a repo, sometimes a demo. The volume is overwhelming — and even when you find a great paper, actually understanding it is hard. You read the abstract, skim the code, maybe watch a YouTube explainer, and you still don't really get it. The gap between "published" and "understood" keeps growing.

## Act 2: Publish a Course with Claude Code

So let's close that gap. I found a paper I want to teach — I'll turn it into a course right now. I go to Course Builder, click Start Building, and I get a terminal session powered by Claude Code.

I paste in the arXiv URL and the GitHub repo. Claude Code reads the paper, analyzes the source code, and starts generating learning stages — concepts, explanations, quizzes — all grounded in the actual paper and the actual code. No hallucinated examples. Real research, real implementations.

It produces a multi-stage dungeon course. Each stage covers a core concept from the paper with an interactive quiz. When it's done, the course gets published with x402 pricing — anyone can see the title and summary for free, but unlocking each stage costs a micropayment in USDC on Base chain.

I just turned a research paper into a monetized course in under a minute. The original paper authors get on-chain attribution through ERC-8021 builder codes. No platform middleman. No subscription. Just pay-per-learn.

## Act 3: Pick a Paper and Learn

Now let's switch to the learner side. Here are the trending papers — same papers you saw on HuggingFace, but now each one is a playable course.

This is the core experience. Left side: a 2D dungeon room. Right side: Claude Code — your AI tutor. Walk around, interact with concept markers to learn, then pass the quiz at the door to advance.

Every stage unlock is a micropayment on Kite Chain. Course creators earn from their content. Your progress is recorded on-chain.

## Act 4: The Knowledge Graph — Humans, Agents, and the World

Learning doesn't happen alone. This is the village — a shared world where researchers and learners coexist in real time. I can see my friends on the map, which courses they're in, what stage they've reached. When someone clears a stage, everyone gets notified.

Over here is the leaderboard — who's learning the most, who's going deepest. And this is the community knowledge graph. Every paper explored, every concept learned, every course published — it all connects into a single graph. Nodes are concepts. Edges are relationships — "extends," "related to." Color shows depth of understanding.

This isn't just a learner graph. Course creators — humans and autonomous agents like Cogito — contribute too. A researcher publishes a course. An agent discovers new papers and enriches lessons. A learner explores a concept deeper than anyone before. All of it feeds the same graph. The frontier map shows where the community's knowledge is dense and where it's still uncharted.

Humans, agents, and the world's research — connected in one living knowledge graph on the AIN blockchain.

## Closing

Papers with Claude Code closes the gap between "published" and "understood." Find a paper, publish a course, learn with AI, share what you know. Thank you.
