## Act 1: The Problem

Look at this famous paperswithcode.com. Every single day, dozens of new AI papers drop with code. Transformers, diffusion models, agents — you read the abstract, skim the code, maybe watch a YouTube explainer, and you still don't really get it. The gap between "published" and "understood" keeps growing.

## Act 2: Publish a Course with Claude Code

So let's close that gap using paperswith**claude**code.com. I found a paper I want to teach or learn — I'll turn it into a course right now. I go to Course Builder, click Start Building, and I get a terminal session powered by Claude Code.

I paste in the arXiv URL and the GitHub repo. I'll use the legendary "Attention Is All You Need" paper. Claude Code starts generating learning stages — concepts, explanations, quizzes — structured based on knowledge graph.

When it's done, Claude Code published with x402 pricing natively integrated. Anyone can see the title and summary for free, but unlocking each core concept costs a micropayment in USDC on Base chain.

The original paper authors get on-chain attribution and automatic royalty splits through ERC-8021 builder codes. No monthly subscriptions locking users out. Just a pure, peer-to-peer, pay-per-learn economy.

## Act 3: Pick a Paper and Learn

Now let's switch to the learner side. Here are the trending papers — but now each one is a playable, monetized course.

Left side: your interactive 2D dungeon room. Right side: personalized and customized Claude Code deployed on the Kubernetes — your AI tutor. You navigate through the concept markers to learn, then pass the quiz at the end of the module to unlock to the next level of understanding using x402. Meanwhile, your progress, your verified skills, and your completed modules are recorded on-chain, building your decentralized learning passport.

## Act 4: The World Knowledge Graph for Humans and Agents

This is the academic village — a shared world where researchers, creators, learners, autonomous agents like Cogito coexist in real time. I can see my friends on the map, which courses they're in, what stage they've reached. When someone clears a stage, everyone gets notified. Over here is the leaderboard — who's learning the most, who's going deepest. And this is the community knowledge graph. Nodes are concepts. Edges are relationships. Color shows depth of understanding.

## Closing

Papers with Claude Code is all about relationship. Learn the knowledge with friends, and build the world knowledge, together. Thank you.
