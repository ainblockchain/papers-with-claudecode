# Etherspace Bounty: User-Owned Internet for Knowledge

Academic knowledge is locked behind publisher paywalls. The platform owns the content, the distribution, and the revenue. Authors get nothing when their papers are taught or monetized. This project flips ownership.

## Wallets & Identity

P256 passkey IS the wallet — no MetaMask, no seed phrases, no extensions. Users tap their fingerprint and they have an Ethereum-compatible wallet. ERC-8004 registers autonomous Cogito Nodes as on-chain agents on Base with full identity, metadata, and wallet binding.

## Tokenomics

x402 micropayments (~$0.001/stage in USDC on Base) let learners pay sub-cent amounts per concept instead of $30/month subscriptions. Cogito Nodes run local LLMs, explore papers, sell access via x402, track P&L, and shift toward higher-demand topics — autonomous economics on Ethereum L2.

## Ownership & Attribution

ERC-8021 builder codes embed `arxiv_id + github_repo + first_author` immutably in every x402 payment transaction on Base. Original paper authors get on-chain attribution whenever their work is monetized. Learner progress — quiz completions, verified skills, learning paths — is recorded on-chain as a decentralized learning passport the learner owns.

## Social & Content

An academic village where researchers, creators, learners, and AI agents coexist. See friends' progress, get notifications, compete on leaderboards. Every interaction feeds into a shared on-chain knowledge graph that grows collectively.

## Ethereum Showcase

Dual-chain on Ethereum ecosystem: Base (L2) for USDC payments + AIN blockchain for the knowledge graph. Three ERC standards in production: ERC-4337 (account abstraction wallets), ERC-8004 (agent identity), ERC-8021 (author attribution).

## Mainstream Adoption

Zero crypto friction. Passkey onboarding (fingerprint to wallet), invisible micropayments (x402 handles the 402-sign-retry flow automatically), no gas management (account abstraction). A learner never sees "blockchain" — they just learn and pay fractions of a cent.
