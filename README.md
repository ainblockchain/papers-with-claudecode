# Papers with Claude Code

A knowledge graph-based learning platform that connects academic papers and GitHub repositories for educational content, enabling a shared learning management system with friends.

## Features

- **Knowledge Graph Construction** - Automatically extract and connect key concepts, methods, and findings across papers
- **Paper-to-Code Linking** - Map academic papers to their corresponding GitHub repositories and implementations
- **Shared Learning Management** - Collaborate with friends to track reading progress, share annotations, and discuss insights
- **Educational Content Curation** - Organize papers and repos into structured learning paths
- **Social Learning** - Share knowledge graphs with peers, compare notes, and learn together
