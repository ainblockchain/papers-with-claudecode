# GitHub OAuth (required for real authentication)
# Create a GitHub OAuth App: https://github.com/settings/developers
# Set Authorization callback URL to: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=

# NextAuth secret (required for real authentication)
# Generate with: npx auth secret
AUTH_SECRET=

# When AUTH_GITHUB_ID is set → real GitHub OAuth is used.
# When AUTH_GITHUB_ID is empty/missing → mock auth is used for development.
