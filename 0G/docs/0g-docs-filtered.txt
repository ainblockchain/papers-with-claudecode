This is a great initiative! To build an effective educational tool or quickstart kit for the 0G bounty, you need to strip away the infrastructure-heavy content (like Node Sales, KYC, and deep hardware node-running guides) and focus strictly on developer integration.

Here is the filtered, structured learning content extracted from the documentation, organized into modules that you can use to build your tutorials, scaffolding tools, or "Learn 0G" interactive courses.

🛠️ Module 1: Network Basics & Quickstart
This module covers the essential network parameters developers need to connect their tools (wallets, Hardhat, Foundry, etc.) to 0G.

Testnet (Galileo)


Chain ID: 16602 


RPC Endpoint: https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai 


Faucet: https://faucet.0g.ai (provides 0.1 0G/day) 


Block Explorer: https://chainscan-galileo.0g.ai 

Mainnet (Aristotle)


Chain ID: 16661 


RPC Endpoint: https://evmrpc.0g.ai 


Block Explorer: https://chainscan.0g.ai 

⛓️ Module 2: Smart Contract Development
0G Chain is a high-speed EVM-compatible Layer 1 optimized for AI workloads, achieving 11,000 TPS per Shard with sub-second finality.


Tooling Compatibility: Because of full EVM compatibility, developers can use existing tools like Hardhat, Foundry, and Remix without changing their Solidity code.
+1


Compilation Requirement: When compiling smart contracts, developers should specify --evm-version cancun to ensure compatibility with the latest EVM upgrades supported by 0G Chain.

Hardhat Configuration Example:

JavaScript
module.exports = {
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.20",
    settings: { evmVersion: "cancun" }
  },
  networks: {
    testnet: {
      url: "https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai",
      chainId: 16602,
      accounts: ["YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"]
    }
  }
};
``` [cite: 4, 5, 394, 397]

Precompiled Contracts: 0G includes native precompiles for advanced features, such as DASigners (0x...1000) for querying Data Availability signatures and Wrapped0GBase (0x...1002) for wrapped native tokens.
+3

💾 Module 3: 0G Storage Integration
0G Storage is a decentralized network designed for massive AI datasets, offering 95% lower costs than AWS and 200 MBPS retrieval speeds.


Storage Types: Supports both an Immutable Log Layer (for ML datasets, archives) and a Mutable Key-Value Layer (for dynamic content, state storage).
+1


TypeScript SDK Installation: npm install @0glabs/0g-ts-sdk ethers.

Uploading a File (TypeScript):

JavaScript
import { ZgFile, Indexer } from "@0glabs/0g-ts-sdk";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai");
const signer = new ethers.Wallet("YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY", provider);
const indexer = new Indexer("https://indexer-storage-testnet-turbo.0g.ai");

const file = await ZgFile.fromFilePath("/path/to/file");
const [tree, treeErr] = await file.merkleTree();
console.log("Root Hash:", tree?.rootHash()); // Save this to download later!

const [tx, uploadErr] = await indexer.upload(file, "https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai", signer);
await file.close();
``` [cite: 11, 787, 792, 793, 794]

Downloading a File: Use the indexer.download(rootHash, outputPath, true) method, where true enables Merkle proof verification.

🧠 Module 4: 0G Compute (Inference & Fine-Tuning)
0G Compute provides a decentralized GPU marketplace offering 90% cheaper AI workloads. It features pay-per-use pricing and smart contract escrow for trustless payments.
+2

1. Account Funding Flow:
Before making API calls, developers must fund their accounts.
+1


Deposit: Transfer funds from your wallet to your Main Account.


Transfer: Move funds from the Main Account to a Provider Sub-Account (specify whether it is for inference or fine-tuning).
+1

2. Inference (OpenAI SDK Compatible):
0G Compute acts as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI SDK.
+1


CLI Setup: 0g-compute-cli inference get-secret --provider <PROVIDER_ADDRESS> generates a Bearer token (app-sk-<SECRET>).
+1

Python Integration:

Python
from openai import OpenAI
# Change base_url to the 0G provider and use the generated secret
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="app-sk-<YOUR_SECRET>",
    base_url="<PROVIDER_URL>/v1/proxy"
)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="<model_name>",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
``` [cite: 14, 15, 23, 24]

3. Fine-Tuning:

Data must be prepared in .jsonl format (e.g., {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}).
+1

Create a task via CLI: 0g-compute-cli fine-tuning create-task --provider <PROVIDER_ADDRESS> --model <MODEL_NAME> --dataset-path <PATH_TO_DATASET> --config-path <PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>.

🤖 Module 5: INFTs (Intelligent NFTs)
If your learning tool focuses on Web3 gaming or AI Agents, INFTs are a massive differentiator.


Concept: Traditional NFTs just point to static metadata, but INFTs (ERC-7857) contain encrypted AI intelligence that transfers with the token.
+1

Privacy-First: The AI model data is stored encrypted via 0G Storage. When the NFT changes hands, a secure oracle (via TEE or ZKP) re-encrypts the key so only the new owner can access the AI agent's logic.
+1


Use Cases: AI Trading bots, personal assistants, intelligent gaming NPCs, and AI-as-a-service.
+1

📊 Module 6: 0G DA (Data Availability)

Concept: 0G DA provides infinitely scalable data availability for Rollups and L2s, capable of 50 Gbps throughput.
+1


Integration: Primarily used by Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers or developers building OP Stack / Arbitrum Nitro rollups to store transaction data securely off-Ethereum while maintaining high security.

Next Step Ideas for Your Project:
You could use this filtered content to build a CLI tool (e.g., create-0g-app) that scaffolds a Next.js frontend, a Foundry smart contract pointing to the 0G Testnet, and a backend route pre-configured with the @0glabs/0g-ts-sdk for storage.

Would you like me to help draft the README.md or a specific code snippet for the create-0g-app scaffold based on this information?
